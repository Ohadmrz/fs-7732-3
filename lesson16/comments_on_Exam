look at grades as the amount of how you should improve

1. using sets to detect rectange and it's sides, or just writing for to detect unique elements
2. noone did the check for already existing shape in complex


 if 'rectangle' not in shapes_dict:
                    shapes_dict['rectangle'] = [[f'sides: {shape}, area: {rectanble_area(shape)}, perimeter: {rectangle_perimeter(shape)}']]
                else:
                    shapes_dict['rectangle'].append([f'sides: {shape}, area: {rectanble_area(shape)}, perimeter: {rectangle_perimeter(shape)}'])
